# @types/color-space

* `index.d.ts` exports full space with all conversions.
* `*.d.ts` exports individual color spaces.

Types are kept as meaningfully minimal as possible.

## Why not generating from jsdoc?

* Proper jsdoc declarations introduce hacks to js files and don't attain clear results.
* JSdoc lacks necessary capabilities like merging interfaces.
* Generated types overall look wrong.
